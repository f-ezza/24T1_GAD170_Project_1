  enemyDescription: The light armored enemy goblin is a nimble and agile adversary,
    equipped with minimal but strategic protection. With swift movements and a keen
    sense of evasion, this goblin relies on its agility to outmaneuver foes rather
    than relying on heavy armor. Its light armor provides some defense without compromising
    speed, allowing the goblin to dart in and out of combat with finesse. Though
    lacking in robust protection, this creature compensates with quick strikes and
    elusive tactics, making it a formidable opponent for those unprepared for its
    agile and cunning fighting style.
